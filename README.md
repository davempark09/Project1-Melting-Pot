Built a website called the Melting Pot using HTML-CSS-JavaScript and API calling from https://www.themealdb.com/. The purpose of this project is to deliver quality food information to people who wish to cook more with the ingredients they have at the moment with the hopes it will lead to less eating out and also less food waste. The target end user for this project would be everyone from professional cooks to everday families. URL: http://127.0.0.1:5500/Page%202.html
